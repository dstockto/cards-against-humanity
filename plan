players are subscribed to a room
for each room, there is a deck of white cards and a deck of black cards
each player draws ten cards
a random order is picked for Card Czar turns
when a player is the Card Czar, they draw a black card and they wait until the other players play white cards, which are not shown (30 second timeout)
once the others play cards, the Card Czar reviews them (without knowing who played what) and picks the best card.
the player who played the best white card keeps the black card and their Awesome Points are incremented.
players can vote to end the game with a haiku round: each player draws 2 more cards and picks 3 in a dramatic order.
